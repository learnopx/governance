The OpenSwitch Project Governance Documentation
===============================================

OpenSwitch is an Open Source Linux distribution targeting networking switches
and virtual machines. As such, it includes packages and functionality which
are specific to operating in this type of environment. The project is run
according to the governance documents detailed herein.

The documents in this tree all describe the governance around OpenSwitch.
As OpenSwitch is an Open Source project, patches to these governance
documents are encouraged. As the project grows, the governance around it
will also grow and mature in lock-step.
