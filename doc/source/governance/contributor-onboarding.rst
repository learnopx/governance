Contributor Onboarding
======================

For new contributors, the following should be helpful to get up to speed
quickly and contribute to the project.

Contributing
------------

Discussions around OpenSwitch development are held in two places:

* The openswitch-dev mailing list.
* The #openswitch channel on Freenode_.

New contributors should be sure to subscribe to the mailing list and to add
#openswitch to their IRC client. To join the mailing list, go to
lists.openswitch.org and follow the instructions to join the mailing list
"openswitch-dev" there. To join Freenode_, select an IRC client for your
operating system, join Freenode, and ensure you add the #openswitch channel
to your list of channels. Webchat_ is a good system for those new to IRC
who want to quickly get up and running with IRC.

Licensing of Contributions
--------------------------

OpenSwitch uses a combination of the standard Developer Certificate of
Origin (DCO_) and a Contributor License Agreement (CLA) for all
contributions. The dual-stacked approach allows for the following:

* Corporate entities must execute the corporate CLA  before their employees
  may contribute.
* Everyone submitting code adds the (DCO_) to their commits.

The CCLA text can be found in the appropriate documents.

The exact text for the DCO used by OpenSwitch is as follows::

   Developer's Certificate of Origin 1.1

   By making a contribution to this project, I certify that:

   (a) The contribution was created in whole or in part by me and I
       have the right to submit it under the open source license
       indicated in the file; or

   (b) The contribution is based upon previous work that, to the best
       of my knowledge, is covered under an appropriate open source
       license and I have the right under that license to submit that
       work with modifications, whether created in whole or in part
       by me, under the same open source license (unless I am
       permitted to submit under a different license), as indicated
       in the file; or

   (c) The contribution was provided directly to me by some other
       person who certified (a), (b) or (c) and I have not modified
       it.

   (d) I understand and agree that this project and the contribution
       are public and that a record of the contribution (including all
       personal information I submit with it, including my sign-off) is
       maintained indefinitely and may be redistributed consistent with
       this project or the open source license(s) involved.

Please note code commits will not include the DCO text above, but rather the
standard "Signed-Off-By" line. The above is meant to replicate the text a
contributor is agreeing to by adding their "Signed-Off-By" to each commit.

IRC Information and Etiquette
-----------------------------

The main IRC channel for OpenSwitch is #openswitch on Freenode. Sub projects
may utilize additional channels, and they should be added below as they
are created and used for OpenSwitch development.

Please note the #openswitch IRC channel is logged publicly.

Weekly Meetings
---------------
OpenSwitch holds a weekly IRC meeting. This meeting is held on Freenode in
the #openswitch channel. The meeting is held at 1700 UTC on Wednesdays.
Please note the OpenSwitch meeting follows UTC and not DST.
